      <h1>Who Are We?</h1>
      <p>My name is Ashley. I'm 16 years old and I founded 747 Apparel.</p>
      <p>I came up with this idea while I was in the hospital dealing a Bone Marrow Transplant. The reason why I had a Bone Marrow Transplant was because I was trying to cure my Sickle Cell Disease.</p>
      <p>As long as I can remember I always had Sickle Cell Disease. For those who don't know, Sickle Cell Disease is a blood disorder that can effect your daily life. It causes you to have chronic pain all over your body. </p>
      <p>I had Sickle Cell since I was born and it has been affecting my life ever since. For the longest time I've considered the hospital I go to my second home becuase I'm always there.</p>
      <p>When I was in 8th grade my parents told me that I would be going through the process of a Bone Marrow Transplant. In the fall of 2016, I started my treatment at New York Presbyterian.</p>
      <p>It was truly the hardest thing I've been through. While I was in there I had an idea to make T-shirts and whatever profit I make, half of the proceeds will go to a charities that affiliate themselves with Sickle Cell Disease.</p>
      <p>I want to give back I know how hard it is living with Sickle Cell Disease: I want to give back, help, and inspire other people who are dealing with Sickle Cell Disease. </p>
      <p>Today I don't have Sickle Cell Disease but I now have the Trait. It's definitely something I have to get used to but I'm always up for the challenge! </p>
